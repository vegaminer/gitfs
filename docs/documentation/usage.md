## Installing

1. Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 are fully supported for now.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:presslabs/gitfs
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitfs
```

2. For using gitfs on Mac, the steps are as follows:

Prerequisites
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
```
brew install gitfs
```

### Mounting

Before mounting, you’ll need a working git repository. You can use a [local repository](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server) or maybe a git service like [GitHub](http://github.com/).

In order to mount your repository to the desired directory, use:

```
gitfs http://your.com/repository.git /mount/directory
```

You my also put it into /etc/fstab to be able to use mount/umount commands.

```
gitfs#https://github.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>.git /mnt/<repo_name> fuse log=/var/log/gitfs.<repo_name>.log,debug=false,foreground=false,log_level=warning,max_size=0,commiter_name=<some_user_name_even_fake_one>,commiter_email=<your_email>,user=www-data,group=www-data,username=<github_user_name>,password=<github_password>,allow_other=true 0 0
```

Now it'll be mounted during system start and you may use mount /mnt/<repo_name> or umount /mnt/<repo_name>. Note that www-data is a user on your server who will have read/write access to /mnt/<repo_name>/current directory

### Directory structure

`current/` – contains a snapshot of the commit that the branch’s HEAD is pointing to. Any changes made here will be automatically committed and pushed to the repository you have mounted.

`history/` – contains a series of directories whose names are dates. In these directories you will find each commit’s read-only snapshot categorized by the time and SHA of that commit. Every snapshot will be read-only.

The history folder can look like this:

```shell
2014-09-15
    12:33:26-b6758e0c38
    15:52:02-68a2154362
    16:14:52-1d5e4f71ba
    16:16:40-c74a4d8078
    16:17:24-cf3f4fbad8
2014-09-17
    11:19:55-256c692b89
    14:30:25-0ab3d88431
    15:04:21-8e214eb797
2014-09-18
    11:40:06-9e154650f1
    16:05:23-cebf6b7388
```

The inner folders are the snapshots of their respective commits.

### Keeping things up to date

`gitfs` automatically fetches the newest changes from your repository at a given time interval. The default delay between fetches is `30s` but you can change this value with the `fetch_delay` argument. See [Arguments](arguments.md) for more details.
